# CFD Analysis of Martian Helicopter Ingenuity and Thrust Calculation

## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of **NASA's Martian Helicopter Ingenuity** to determine the thrust produced by its coaxial rotors in the **Martian CO2 atmosphere.**

## Motivation:
NASA's Mars Helicopter Ingenuity represents a groundbreaking advancement in planetary exploration. Understanding the aerodynamic performance of its rotors and the thrust generated in the unique Martian atmosphere was crucial for optimizing its operations and mission success. I am personally interested in Space tech and Rockets. Analysing the Ingenuity was not only exciting but also educational and informative.

## Methodology:
- **Software Used:** ANSYS Workbench 2023 R1/ANSYS Fluent
- **Turbulence Model:** Hybrid RANS/Spalart-Allmaras (SA) with Detached Eddy Simulation (DES).
- **3D Modeling & Mesh Generation:** I created a 3d model in SolidWorks and then imported the geometry in ANSYS. I employed a Face sizing of 10mm at the propeller surfaces and 50mm at the fluid domain. 
- **Simulation Setup:**
  - The fluid used was Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as in Martian Atmosphere with following properties:
    - Density: 0.017kg/m^3
    - Viscousity: 1.46e-5 N/kg
    - Temp: 293K
    - Gravity = 3.71 m/s^2 ( Earth Gravity = 9.81m/s^2)
  - The blade walls were set to adiabatic, no-slip boundary condition.
  - Transient solution calculated over 250 timesteps of 0.001s each.
- **Post-processing:** Analysis of results using ANSYS CFD-Post Software.
  - The velocity and pressure contours were made along verticle plane.
  - Plots of Velocity and Pressure along the verticle axis (Y-Axis) were made.
  - Hand calculation was made using the MATLAB ( F_th = 0.5*rho*A*(v_e^2 - v_o^2) )
 
## Directory Structure:
- **/src:** Contains source code and scripts used for mesh generation, simulation setup, and post-processing
- **/docs:** Documentation files, including setup instructions, methodology details, and analysis results
- **/data:** Input data files and sample results
